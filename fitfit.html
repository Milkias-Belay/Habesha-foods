                <b>Ingredients</b>
                <pre>
<b>Kicha fitfit</b>
3 tablespoons unsalted butter or ghee
1 tablespoon berbere (homemade or store-bought)
1 batch Kicha (recipe below), torn into bite-size pieces (about 6 cups)
1/2 teaspoon kosher salt
1 cup plain yogurt
<b>Kicha</b>
1 1/2 cups whole-wheat flour
1 cup all-purpose flour
2 teaspoons kosher salt
1 1/2 cups warm water
2 tablespoons canola oil
                </pre>
                <b>Method</b><br>
                <b>kicha fitfit</b>
                1.Place the butter in a large nonstick skillet set over medium heat. Once the butter melts, add the berbere and cook, stirring, until the spices sizzle and smell fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add the kicha pieces and sprinkle with the salt. Cook, stirring, until all the pieces of kicha are coated with the spiced butter and warmed through, about 3 minutes. Transfer the mixture to a serving platter or individual bowls, top with the yogurt, and serve immediately. <br>

                1.Place the whole wheat and all-purpose flours and salt in a large bowl and whisk well to combine. Using your hands, mix in the water. The batter will be like a very thick pancake batter. <br>
                2.Line a plate with paper towels and set aside. Set a 12-inch nonstick skillet over medium heat and add 1 tablespoon of the oil, tilting the pan so the oil lightly greases the bottom of the pan. Once the oil is hot, add half the dough to the skillet and use wet fingertips to gently and carefully press the dough into a wide circle that covers the surface of the skillet. Cover the skillet and cook until the top of the dough is glossy and the underside is golden brown, about 3 minutes. Carefully flip the bread over, cover, and cook until the second side is browned, another 2 to 3 minutes. Transfer the flatbread to the prepared plate, adding the remaining 1 tablespoon oil to the pan, and repeat the process with the remaining dough. Serve immediately while the breads are warm, or let cool to room temperature to use for Kicha Fit Fit. Leftover breads can be stored in a plastic bag at room temperature for a day and rewarmed in a skillet over low heat.
