                <b>Ingredients</b>
                <pre>
 Oil: I used olive because that's what I had on hand, but Ethiopian lentils are traditionally made with clarified butter
Onion: I like using a sweet white onion in my recipes since red tends to be a bit sharper in its flavor.
Garlic: we'll use 3 minced garlic cloves to help build flavor
Tomato + tomato paste: this helps build the color and sweetness of the dish. I used a fresh chopped tomato and organic tomato paste.
Berbere: the traditional Ethiopian spice blend
Red lentils: they're quick to cook and have a really nice thick texture when they cook down
Broth + water: to keep it vegetarian/vegan, use vegetable broth. If you are okay with chicken, you can use that instead. We'll also use a bit of water to thin it out.
                </pre>
                <b>Method</b>
                And in terms of making it, we basically just start by sweating out our onions. Then add the garlic and tomatoes and let them cook until fragrant. Then we add our spices, lentils, broth, and water <br>
                 (and a pinch of salt of course!), and cook it until the lentils are soft and the stew is nice and thick!
